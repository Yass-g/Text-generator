# Text-generator
A text-generating program, based on a collection of text, in Java.
The algorithm is mainly about creating a hash map which associates to each sequence of n words (n being chosen as an argument) in the input text its prefix. Hence, the program will chose randomly for each word a sequence present in the original text and so on.<br/>
Provided as an exemple some chapters of "Madame Bovary" by gustave flobert in French, and some chapters of "The Odyssey" and "The Illiad" by Homer, in both formats.
